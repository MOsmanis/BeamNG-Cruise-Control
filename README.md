# Cruise-Control

Practical work for Bachelor's thesis
Cruise Control PID algorithm implementation in Python for BeamNG.research.
Using BeamNGpy API to control throttle and map in BeamNG.research.(https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy)
Later extended to Adaptive Cruise Control, slowing down if there is a car ahead.

Adding the test levels to Beamng.Research :

Go to Cruise-Control/levels directory and extract the rar file of map into - 'research\trunk\levels'

To use the map for testing, change the name of used map in scripts/PID.py#99
